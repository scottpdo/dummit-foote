Prove that $|GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)| = 6$.

\begin{proof}
    Matrices in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ have the form 
    $\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix}$, 
    where $a, b, c, d \in \{0, 1\}$. There are 16 possible matrices of this form (2 options for each entry over 4 entries, $2^4 = 16$).
    
    From the definition of $GL_2$, we discount matrices with determinant 0. A $2 \times 2$ matrix has determinant 0 when $ad - bc = 0$, that is, $ad = bc$. This happens only when $ad = bc = 1$ or $ad = bc = 0$. There is only one matrix where $ad = bc = 1, \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$. Matrices with determinant 0 have one of $a, d$ and $b, c$ equal to 0. They are the matrices with all zero entries (1), with three zero entries (4), and with two zero entries ($a$ and $b$, or $a$ and $c$, or $b$ and $d$, or $c$ and $d$) (4).

    This leaves us with $16 - 1 - 1 - 4 - 4 = 6$ matrices with nonzero determinants, so the order of $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2) = 6$.
\end{proof}

\section*{2. (3/16/23)}

Write out all the elements of $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ and compute the order of each element.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$: 1 (identity)
    \item $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$: 2
    \item $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$: 2
    \item $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$: 3
    \item $\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$: 3
    \item $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}$: 2
\end{itemize}

\section*{3. (3/16/23)}

Show that $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ is non-abelian.

\begin{proof}
    To prove that $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ is non-abelian, we need only show that it contains two non-commuting elements.

    $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix}$.

    However, $\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 1\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$. These products are not equal, so $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ is non-abelian.
\end{proof}

\section*{4. (3/18/23)}

Show that if $n$ is not prime then $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field.

\begin{proof}
    Let $n$ be a composite positive integer and let $a$ divide $n$ with $a > 1$. We will show that $a$ does not have a multiplicative inverse in $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and therefore $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field.

    We will show that there is no integer $c$ such that $ac = 1$ mod $n$. Since $a$ divides $n$, let $ab = n = 0$ mod $n$. So $a(b + 1) = ab + a = n + a = a$ mod $n$. That is, for the pair of consecutive integers $b$ and $b + 1$, we have $ab = 0 < 1$ and $a(b + 1) = a > 1$. Then there is no integer $c$ strictly between $b$ and $b + 1$ such that $ac = 1$ mod $n$. For any larger integers, we note that $abk = nk = 0$ mod $n$, and $a(bk + 1) = abk + a = nk + a = a$ mod $n$, and therefore there is no integer $c$ among all of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ with $ac = 1$. Therefore, since $a$ has no multiplicative inverse, $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is not a field.
\end{proof}

\section*{5. (3/18/23)}

Show that $GL_n(F)$ is a finite group if and only if $F$ has a finite number of elements.

\begin{proof}
    Let $F$ be a field with $m < \infty$ elements and, for some $n > 1$, let $GL_n(F)$ be the general linear group of degree $n$ on $F$. The total possible number of $n \times n$ matrices with entries from $F$ is $m^{n^2}$. Since the number of elements in $GL_n(F)$ is strictly less than this value, it is a finite group.

    To prove the converse, we will show that, if $F$ is an infinite field, then $GL_n(F)$ must not be a finite group. Let $F$ be an infinite field. For every $x \in F$ (excluding $x = 0$), we can construct an $n \times n$ matrix whose diagonal entries are $x$ and all other entries are 0. By definition, the determinant of such a matrix is the product of the diagonal entries, $x^n \neq 0$. Therefore such a matrix belongs to $GL_n(F)$. This is a bijection between $F$ and $GL_n(F)$, and so they have the same cardinality, that is, $GL_n(F)$ must not be a finite group.

    Thus, $GL_n(F)$ is a finite group if and only if $F$ has a finite number of elements.
\end{proof}
