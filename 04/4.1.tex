Let $G$ be a group and $A$ be a nonempty set.

\section*{1. (12/24/23)}

Let $G$ act on the set $A$. Prove that if $a, b \in A$ and $b = g \cdot a$ for some $g \in G$, then $G_b = gG_ag^{-1}$ ($G_a$ is the stabilizer of $a$). Deduce that if $G$ acts transitively on $A$ then the kernel of the action is $\cap_{g \in G}\hspace{0.25em}gG_ag^{-1}$.

\begin{proof}
    We will show first that $G_b$, the stabilizer of $b$, is contained in $gG_ag^{-1}$, and then show the converse, which proves that they are equal.

    Let $x \in G_b$, so $x \cdot b = b$. Then:
    \begin{align*}
        x \cdot g \cdot a &= g \cdot a \text{ ($b = g \cdot a$)} \\
        (gg^{-1}) \cdot (xg) \cdot a &= g \cdot a \text{ ($gg^{-1} = 1, 1 \cdot a = a$)} \\
        g \cdot (g^{-1}xg) \cdot a &= g \cdot a \\
        (g^{-1}xg) \cdot a &= a,
    \end{align*}
    which implies that $g^{-1}xg \in G_a$, and therefore $x \in gG_ag^{-1}$, so $G_b \subseteq gG_ag^{-1}$.

    The converse, that $gG_ag^{-1} \subseteq G_b$, can be shown by following the above proof in reverse (that is, let $x \in gG_ag^{-1}$, so $g^{-1}xg \in G_a$, which implies that $(g^{-1}xg) \cdot a = a$, and each assertion holds from bottom to top). Since each is contained in the other, we have $G_b = gG_ag^{-1}$.

    Now we already know that the kernel of the group action of $G$ on $A$ is the intersection of the stabilizers of all the elements of $A$, that is, $\cap_{b \in A}\hspace{0.25em}G_b$. If $G$ acts transitively on $A$, fixing $a \in A$, then for all $b \in A$, we can write $b = g \cdot a$ for some $g \in G$, which from above implies that $G_b = gG_ag^{-1}$. We deduce that the kernel can be expressed in terms of a fixed element $a$, namely:
    \begin{equation*}
        \cap_{b \in A}\hspace{0.25em}G_b = \cap_{b \in A}\hspace{0.25em}\underbrace{gG_ag^{-1}}_{b = g \cdot a} = \cap_{g \in G}\hspace{0.25em}gG_ag^{-1}.
    \end{equation*}
    We know that $\cap_{g \in G}\hspace{0.25em}gG_ag^{-1}$ intersects all of the same conjugates as does $\cap_{b \in A}$, since $G$ acts transitively on $A$. And, since $b = g \cdot a \Rightarrow G_b = gG_ag^{-1}$, it intersects no conjugates not represented by $G_b$ for all $b \in A$.
\end{proof}

\section*{2. (1/2/24)}

Let $G$ be a \emph{permutation group} on the set $A$ (i.e., $G \leq S_A$), let $\sigma \in G$ and let $a \in A$. Prove that $\sigma G_a \sigma^{-1} = G_{\sigma(a)}$. Deduce that if $G$ acts transitively on $A$ then
\begin{equation*}
    \bigcap_{\sigma \in G} \sigma G_a \sigma^{-1} = 1.
\end{equation*}

\begin{proof}
    We first show that $\sigma G_a \sigma^{-1} \subseteq G_{\sigma(a)}$, and then show the converse. To begin, let $\tau \in G_a$ and consider $\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \in \sigma G_a \sigma^{-1}$. We note that:
    \begin{equation*}
        (\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1})(\sigma(a)) = (\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \sigma)(a) = (\sigma \tau)(a) = \underbrace{\sigma(\tau(a)) = \sigma(a)}_{\tau \in G_a \Rightarrow \tau(a) = a},
    \end{equation*}
    and so $\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1}$ stabilizes $\sigma(a)$, which implies that $\sigma G_a \sigma^{-1} \subseteq G_{\sigma(a)}$.

    For the converse, let $\tau \in G$ and suppose that $\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \in G_{\sigma(a)}$. Then:
    \begin{align*}
        (\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1})(\sigma(a)) &= \sigma(a) \\
        (\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \sigma)(a) &= \sigma(a) \\
        (\sigma \tau)(a) &= \sigma(a) \\
        \sigma(\tau(a)) &= \sigma(a) \\
        \tau(a) &= a,
    \end{align*}
    so $\tau$ is in the stabilizer of $a$, which implies that $\sigma \tau \sigma^{-1} \in \sigma G_a \sigma^{-1}$, and so $G_{\sigma(a)} \subseteq \sigma G_a \sigma^{-1}$.
    
    This concludes the proof that $\sigma G_a \sigma^{-1} = G_{\sigma(a)}$.

    Now if $G$ acts transitively on $A$, then there is only one orbit; that is, given some $a \in A$, for all $b \in A$, there is a $\sigma \in G$ such that $b = \sigma(a)$.

    From above, we conclude:
    \begin{equation*}
        \bigcap_{\sigma \in G} \sigma G_a \sigma^{-1} = \bigcap_{\sigma \in G} G_{\sigma(a)} =
        \bigcap_{a \in A} G_a \text{ (because $G$ acts transitively on $A$),}
    \end{equation*}
    and since the only permutation that fixes every element of $A$ is the identity, this intersection consists therefore only the identity permutation.
\end{proof}

\section*{3. (1/2/24)}

Assume that $G$ is an abelian, transitive subgroup of $S_A$. Show that $\sigma(a) \neq a$ for all $\sigma \in G - \{ 1 \}$ and all $a \in A$. Deduce that $|G| = |A|$. [Use the preceding exercise.]

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $\sigma_1$ fixes $a$, so $\sigma_1(a) = a$, and let $\sigma_2(a) = b$. Then:
    \begin{align*}
        (\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2)(a) = \sigma_1(\sigma_2(a)) &= \sigma_1(b), \text{ and } \\
        (\sigma_2 \circ \sigma_1)(a) = \sigma_2(\sigma_1(a)) &= \sigma_2(a).
    \end{align*}
    Since $G$ is abelian, these must be equal, and so $\sigma_1(b) = \sigma_2(a) = b$. Then $\sigma_1$ also fixes $b$.
    
    Since $G$ is transitive, for every $b \in A$, there exists a $\sigma \in G$ such that $\sigma(b) = a$, which implies that $\sigma_1$ fixes every element of $A$ and is therefore the identity. Thus the identity is the only element of $G$ for which $\sigma(a) = a$; equivalently, $\sigma(a) \neq a$ for all $\sigma \in G - \{ 1 \}$ and all $a \in A$.

    Now let $A = \{ 1, ..., n \}$. Since $G$ is transitive, it must contain at least $n$ permutations. For all $i \in A$, define $\sigma_i$ such that $\sigma_i(1) = i$ (with $\sigma_1$ the identity permutation). Suppose that $\tau$ is another permutation in $G$. Since $A$ only contains $n$ elements, we must have $\tau(1) = i$ for some $i \in A$, so $\tau(1) = \sigma_i(1)$. Then:
    \begin{align*}
        (\tau \circ \sigma_i)(1) = \tau(\sigma_i(1)) &= \tau(i), \text{ and } \\
        (\sigma_i \circ \tau)(1) = \sigma_i(\tau(1)) &= \sigma_i(i).
    \end{align*}
    Since $G$ is abelian, these are equal, so $\tau(i) = \sigma_i(i)$. It follows that, if $j = \tau(i) = \sigma_i(i)$, then $\tau(j) = \sigma_i(j)$, and so on for every element which $\sigma_i$ permutes. Therefore $\tau = \sigma_i$, so $G$ contains exactly $n$ permutations. We conclude that $|G| = |A|$.
\end{proof}

Let $S_3$ act on the set $\Omega$ of ordered pairs: $\{ (i, j) \mid 1 \leq i, j \leq 3 \}$ by $\sigma((i, j)) = (\sigma(i), \sigma(j))$. Find the orbits of $S_3$ on $\Omega$. For each $\sigma \in S_3$ find the cycle decomposition of $\sigma$ under this action (i.e., find its cycle decomposition when $\sigma$ is considered as an element of $S_9$ â€” first fix a labelling of these nine ordered pairs). For each orbit $\mathcal{O}$ of $S_3$ acting on these nine points pick some $a \in \mathcal{O}$ and find the stabilizer of $a$ in $S_3$.

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    The elements $(1, 1), (2, 2),$ and $(3, 3)$ all belong to the same orbit. We see that $(1\,2) \cdot (1, 1) = (2, 2)$ and $(2\,3) \cdot (2, 2) = (3, 3)$. Further, since for any $(i, i) \in \Omega$, the action of $\sigma \in S_3$ on it results in an element with the same coordinates, there is no $(i, j) \in \Omega$ with $i \neq j$ such that $\sigma((i, i)) = (i, j)$. Therefore these three elements constitute one orbit.

    The other orbit consists of the remaining six elements. Beginning with $(1, 2)$, we have:
    \begin{align*}
        (1\,2\,3)(1, 2) &= (2, 3), \text{ then} \\
        (1\,2\,3)(2, 3) &= (3, 1), \\
        (1\,2)(3, 1) &= (3, 2), \\
        (1\,2\,3)(3, 2) &= (1, 3), \text{ and finally} \\
        (1\,2\,3)(1, 3) &= (2, 1).
    \end{align*}
    Conversely to the first orbit, for no $(i, j) \in \Omega$ with $i \neq j$ do we have $\sigma((i, j)) = (i, i)$. Thus these are the two disjoint orbits of $S_3$ on $\Omega$.

    Next, let us label the elements of $\Omega$:
    \begin{align*}
        (1, 1) \rightarrow 1 & & (1, 2) \rightarrow 2 & & (1, 3) \rightarrow 3 \\
        (2, 1) \rightarrow 4 & & (2, 2) \rightarrow 5 & & (2, 3) \rightarrow 6 \\
        (3, 1) \rightarrow 7 & & (3, 2) \rightarrow 8 & & (3, 3) \rightarrow 9
    \end{align*}
    Then we can describe the cycle decomposition of each permutation of $S_3$ by how it acts on these elements:
    \begin{align*}
        1 &\rightarrow 1 \\
        (1\,2) &\rightarrow (1\,5)(2\,4)(3\,6)(7\,8) \\
        (1\,3) &\rightarrow (1\,9)(2\,8)(3\,7)(4\,6) \\
        (2\,3) &\rightarrow (2\,3)(4\,7)(5\,9)(6\,8) \\
        (1\,2\,3) &\rightarrow (1\,5\,9)(2\,6\,7)(3\,4\,8) \\
        (1\,3\,2) &\rightarrow (1\,9\,5)(2\,7\,6)(3\,8\,4)
    \end{align*}
    For the first orbit, let us choose the point $(1, 1)$ and find its stabilizer. The permutations in $S_3$ that fix this element must fix 1. Obviously this includes the identity. Neither of the 3-cycles fix 1. Only one of the 2-cycles, $(2\,3)$, fixes 1. Therefore the stabilizer of $(1, 1)$ is the subgroup $\{ 1, (2\,3) \}$.

    For the second orbit, we choose $(1, 2)$. Since all non-identity permutations of $S_3$ reassign either 1 or 2 (or both), the stabilizer consists of only the identity.
\end{proof}
