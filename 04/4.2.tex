Let $G$ be a group and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$.

\section*{1. (2/12/24)}

Let $G = \{ 1, a, b, c \}$ be the Klein 4-group whose group table is written out in Section 2.5.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), itemsep=0em]
    \item Label $1, a, b, c$ with the integers $1, 2, 4, 3$, respectively, and prove that under the left regular representation of $G$ into $S_4$ the nonidentity elements are mapped as follows:
        \begin{align*}
            a \mapsto (1\, 2)(3\, 4) & & b \mapsto(1\, 4)(2\, 3) & & c \mapsto (1\, 3)(2\, 4).
        \end{align*}
        \begin{proof}
            The left regular representation of $G$ into $S_4$ is the homomorphism $\varphi: G \to S_4$ defined by $\varphi(g) = \sigma_g$, where $\sigma_g: G \to G$ is the permutation of $G$ defined by $\sigma_g(x) = gx$ for all $x \in G$.

            Each non-identity element maps the elements as follows:
            \begin{align*}
                \sigma_a(1) = a1 = a & & \sigma_a(a) = a^2 = 1 & & \sigma_a(b) = ab = c & & \sigma_a(c) = ac = b \\
                \sigma_b(1) = b1 = b & & \sigma_b(a) = ba = c & & \sigma_b(b) = b^2 = 1 & & \sigma_b(c) = bc = a \\
                \sigma_c(1) = c1 = c & & \sigma_c(a) = ca = b & & \sigma_c(b) = cb = a & & \sigma_c(c) = c^2 = 1. 
            \end{align*}
            By the given labeling, this assigns the elements $a, b$, and $c$ to the pairs of 2-cycles shown above.
        \end{proof}
    \item Relabel $1, a, b, c$ as $1, 4, 2, 3$, respectively, and compute the image of each element of $G$ under the left regular representation of $G$ into $S_4$. Show that the image of $G$ in $S_4$ under this labeling is the same \emph{subgroup} as the image of $G$ in part (a) (even though the nonidentity elements individually map to different permutations under the two different labelings).
    \begin{proof}
        Under this labeling, the elements $a, b$, and $c$ are mapped to the permutations $(1\, 4)(2\, 3), (1\, 2)(3\, 4)$, and $(1\, 3)(2\, 4)$, respectively. Although each element maps to a different permutation from part (a), the subgroup of $S_4$ is the same in both cases.
    \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{2. (2/12/24)}

List the elements of $S_3$ as $1, (1\, 2), (2\, 3), (1\, 3), (1\, 2\, 3), (1\, 3\, 2)$ and label these with the integers $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$, respectively. Exhibit the image of each element of $S_3$ under the left regular representation of $S_3$ into $S_6$.

\begin{proof}[Solution]
    First, consider the element $(1\, 2)$. We see that:
    \begin{align*}
        (1\,2)1 &= (1\,2) \mapsto 2 &  (1\,2)(1\,2) &= 1 \mapsto 1 \\
        (1\,2)(2\,3) &= (1\,2\,3) \mapsto 5 & (1\,2)(1\,3) &= (1\,3\,2) \mapsto 6 \\
        (1\,2)(1\,2\,3) &= (2\,3) \mapsto 3 & (1\,2)(1\,3\,2) &= (1\,3) \mapsto 4.
    \end{align*}
    So the left regular representation of $(1\,2)$ under the given labeling in $S_6$ is $(1\,2)(3\,4)(5\,6)$.

    The left regular representations of the remaining elements are:
    \begin{align*}
        (2\,3) &\mapsto (1\,3)(2\,6)(4\,5) \\
        (1\,3) &\mapsto (1\,4)(2\,5)(3\,6) \\
        (1\,2\,3) &\mapsto (1\,5\,6)(2\,4\,3) \\
        (1\,3\,2) &\mapsto (1\,6\,5)(2\,3\,4).
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\section*{3. (2/12/24)}

Let $r$ and $s$ be the usual generators for the dihedral group of order 8.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), itemsep=0em]
    \item List the elements of $D_8$ as $1, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3$ and label these with the integers $1, 2, ..., 8$, respectively. Exhibit the image of each element of $D_8$ under the left regular representation of $D_8$ into $S_8$.
        \begin{align*}
            1 &\mapsto 1 \\
            r &\mapsto (1\,2\,3\,4)(5\,8\,7\,6) \\
            r^2 &\mapsto (1\,3)(2\,4)(5\,7)(6\,8) \\
            r^3 &\mapsto (1\,4\,3\,2)(5\,6\,7\,8) \\
            s &\mapsto (1\,5)(2\,6)(3\,7)(4\,8) \\
            sr &\mapsto (1\,6)(2\,7)(3\,8)(4\,5) \\
            sr^2 &\mapsto (1\,7)(2\,8)(3\,5)(4\,6) \\
            sr^3 &\mapsto (1\,8)(2\,5)(3\,6)(4\,7)
        \end{align*}
    \item Relabel this same list of elements of $D_8$ with the integers $1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8$ respectively and recompute the image of each element of $D_8$ under the left regular representation with respect to this new labeling. Show that the two subgroups of $S_8$ obtained in parts (a) and (b) are different.
        \begin{align*}
            1 &\mapsto 1 \\
            r &\mapsto (1\,3\,5\,7)(2\,8\,6\,4) \\
            r^2 &\mapsto (1\,5)(2\,6)(3\,7)(4\,8) \\
            r^3 &\mapsto (1\,7\,5\,3)(2\,4\,6\,8) \\
            s &\mapsto (1\,2)(3\,4)(5\,6)(7\,8) \\
            sr &\mapsto (1\,4)(2\,7)(3\,6)(5\,8) \\
            sr^2 &\mapsto (1\,6)(2\,5)(3\,8)(4\,7) \\
            sr^3 &\mapsto (1\,8)(2\,3)(4\,5)(6\,7).
        \end{align*}
        We see that the generators of the subgroups of $S_8$ in parts (a) and (b) are different, and so these are different subgroups of $S_8$.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{4. (2/12/24)}

Use the left regular representation of $Q_8$ to produce two elements of $S_8$ which generate a subgroup of $S_8$ isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.

\begin{proof}
    We know that the elements $i$ and $j$ generate the quaternion group $Q_8$. Labeling the elements $1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k$ with $1, 2, ..., 8$ respectively, the elements $i$ and $j$ map to the following permutations in $S_8$:
    \begin{align*}
        i &\mapsto (1\,3\,2\,4)(5\,7\,6\,8) \\
        j &\mapsto (1\,5\,2\,6)(3\,8\,4\,7).
    \end{align*}
    Since the left regular representation of $Q_8$ in $S_8$ is a homomorphism, these two permutations generate a subgroup of $S_8$ isomorphic to $Q_8$.
\end{proof}

\section*{5. (2/12/24)}

Let $r$ and $s$ be the usual generators for the dihedral group of order 8 and let $H = \langle s \rangle$. List the left cosets of $H$ in $D_8$ as $1H, rH, r^2H, r^3H$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), itemsep=0em]
    \item Label these cosets with the integers $1, 2, 3, 4$, respectively. Exhibit the image of each element of $D_8$ under the representation $\pi_H$ of $D_8$ into $S_4$ obtained from the action of $D_8$ by left multiplication on the set of 4 left cosets of $H$ in $D_8$. Deduce that this representation is faithful (i.e., the elements of $S_4$ obtained form a subgroup isomorphic to $D_8$).
        \begin{align*}
            1 &\mapsto 1 & s &\mapsto (2\,4) \\
            r &\mapsto (1\,2\,3\,4) & sr &\mapsto (1\,4)(2\,3) \\
            r^2 &\mapsto (1\,3)(2\,4) & sr^2 &\mapsto (1\,3) \\
            r^3 &\mapsto (1\,4\,3\,2) & sr^3 &\mapsto (1\,2)(3\,4).
        \end{align*}
        Since each element of $D_8$ induces a unique permutation in $S_4$, the resulting image under the left regular representation is isomorphic to $D_8$, and so this representation is faithful.
    \item Repeat part (a) with the list of cosets relabeled by the integers $1, 3, 2, 4$, respectively. Show that the permutations obtained from this labeling form a subgroup of $S_4$ that is different from the subgroup obtained in part (a).
        \begin{align*}
            1 &\mapsto 1 & s &\mapsto (3\,4) \\
            r &\mapsto (1\,3\,2\,4) & sr &\mapsto (1\,4)(2\,3) \\
            r^2 &\mapsto (1\,2)(3\,4) & sr^2 &\mapsto (1\,2) \\
            r^3 &\mapsto (1\,4\,2\,3) & sr^3 &\mapsto (1\,3)(2\,4).
        \end{align*}
        Since the generators (the images of $r$ and $s$) of this subgroup of $S_4$ are different from those in part (a), this is a different subgroup from part (a).
    \item Let $K = \langle sr \rangle$, list the cosets of $K$ in $D_8$ as $1K, rK, r^2K, r^3K$, and label these with the integers $1, 2, 3, 4$. Prove that, with respect to this labeling, the image of $D_8$ under the representation $\pi_K$ obtained from left multiplication on the cosets of $K$ is the same \emph{subgroup} of $S_4$ as in part (a) (even though the subgroups $H$ and $K$ are different and some of the elements of $D_8$ map to different permutations under the two homomorphisms).
        \begin{proof}
            Consider the images of the generators $r$ and $s$ under $\pi_K$:
            \begin{align*}
                r \cdot 1K &= rK & s \cdot 1K &= rK \\
                r \cdot rK &= r^2K & s \cdot rK &= 1K \\
                r \cdot r^2K &= r^3K & s \cdot r^2K &= r^3K \\
                r \cdot r^3K &= 1K & s \cdot r^3K &= r^2K.
            \end{align*}
            So $r$ and $s$ map to $(1\,2\,3\,4)$ and $(1\,2)(3\,4) \in S_4$, respectively. These elements are both in the subgroup in part (a) above, and so they are the same subgroup, but the image of $s$ is different.
        \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
