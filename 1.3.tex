        \begin{itemize}
            \item $(1)$: 1

            \item $(1, 2); (1, 3); (1, 4); (2, 3); (2, 4); (3, 4); (1, 2)(3, 4);\\(1, 3)(2, 4); (1, 4)(2, 3)$: 2
            \item $(1, 2, 3); (1, 3, 2); (1, 2, 4); (1, 4, 2); (1, 3, 4); (1, 4, 3);\\(2, 3, 4); (2, 4, 3)$: 3
            \item $(1, 2, 3, 4); (1, 4, 2, 3); (1, 3, 2, 4); (1, 3, 4, 2); (1, 4, 2, 3); (1, 4, 3, 2)$: 4

\section*{5. (2/16/23)}

Find the order of $(1, 12, 8, 10, 4)(2, 13)(5, 11, 7)(6, 9)$.

\begin{proof}
    The order of a permutation in a symmetric group is the least common multiple of its cycles. However, since we have not yet proven this, we will calculate the first few multiples of the permutation manually, and extrapolate from there. Let $\sigma = (1, 12, 8, 10, 4)(2, 13)(5, 11, 7)(6, 9)$.

    $\sigma^2 = (1, 8, 4, 12, 10)(5, 7, 11)$.

    $\sigma^3 = (1, 10, 12, 4, 8)(2, 13)(6, 9)$.

    $\sigma^4 = (1, 4, 10, 8, 12)(5, 11, 7)$.
    
    $\sigma^5 = (2, 13)(5, 7, 11)(6, 9)$.

    From this pattern, we see that each constituent cycle vanishes from the cycle decomposition when the exponent is a multiple of the cycle's length. Thus, the order of $\sigma$ is the least common multiple of the lengths of its cycles, which is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 30$.
\end{proof}

\section*{6. (2/17/23)}

Write out the cycle decomposition of each element of order 4 in $S_4$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(1, 2, 3, 4)$
    \item $(1, 2, 4, 3)$
    \item $(1, 3, 2, 4)$
    \item $(1, 3, 4, 2)$
    \item $(1, 4, 2, 3)$
    \item $(1, 4, 3, 2)$
\end{itemize}

\section*{7. (2/20/23)}

Write out the cycle decomposition of each element of order 2 in $S_4$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(1, 2)$
    \item $(1, 3)$
    \item $(1, 4)$
    \item $(2, 3)$
    \item $(2, 4)$
    \item $(3, 4)$
    \item $(1, 2)(3, 4)$
    \item $(1, 3)(2, 4)$
    \item $(1, 4)(2, 3)$
\end{itemize}

\section*{8. (2/22/23)}

Prove that if $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3... \}$ then $S_\Omega$ is an infinite group.

\begin{proof}

    Let $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3... \}$. Consider the subset $T$ consisting of all elements whose cycle decomposition is a single 2-cycle permuting $1 \in \Omega$, for example $(1, 2), (1, 10)$ but not $(2, 3)$.

    There is a bijection $f: \mathbb{Z}^+ \rightarrow T$ defined by $f(n) = (1, n + 1)$. Because there is a bijection between these two sets, they have the same cardinality; that is, like $\mathbb{Z}^+$, $T$ is infinite.

    Because $\Omega$ contains a proper subset of infinite size, $\Omega$ has infinite elements and is therefore an infinite group.

\end{proof}
