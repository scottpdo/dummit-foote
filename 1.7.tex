Let $F$ be a field. Show that the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of $F$ (denoted by $F^\times$) acts on the set $F$ by $g \cdot a = ga$, where $g \in F^\times, a \in F$ and $ga$ is the usual product in $F$ of the two field elements.

\begin{proof}
    To show that $F^\times$ acts on $F$, we must show that $g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot a) = (g_1 g_2) \cdot a$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in F^\times, a \in F$, and $1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in F$.

    First, let $g_1, g_2 \in F^\times$ and $a \in F$. By the definition of the action, $g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot a) = g_1 \cdot (g_2 a) = g_1 g_2 a$. By the associativity of multiplication, $g_1 g_2 a = (g_1 g_2) a$. Again by the action definition, this equals $(g_1 g_2) \cdot a$.
    
    It follows directly from the field axiom of multiplicative identity that $1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in A$. Thus $F^\times$ acts on $F$ by $g \cdot a = ga$.
\end{proof}

Show that the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$ acts on itself by $z \cdot a = z + a$ for all $z, a \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\begin{proof}
    First, $z_1 \cdot (z_2 \cdot a) = z_1 \cdot (z_2 + a) = z_1 + z_2 + a = (z_1 + z_2) + a = (z_1 + z_2) \cdot a$.

    Also, $0 \cdot a = 0 + a = a$ for all $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Thus $\mathbb{Z}$ acts on itself by $z \cdot a = z + a$.
\end{proof}

\section*{3. (4/27/23)}

Show that the additive group $\mathbb{R}$ acts on the $x, y$ plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ by $r \cdot (x, y) = (x + ry, y)$.

\begin{proof}
    First, $r_1 \cdot (r_2 \cdot (x, y)) = r_1 \cdot (x + r_2 y, y) = (x + r_2 y + r_1 y, y) = \\ (x + (r_1 + r_2)y, y) = (r_1 + r_2) \cdot (x, y)$.

    Also, $0 \cdot (x, y) = (x + 0y, y) = (x, y)$ for all $(x, y) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$. Thus $\mathbb{R}$ acts on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ by $r \cdot (x, y) = (x + ry, y)$.
\end{proof}

Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $A$ and fix some $a \in A$. Show that the following sets are subgroups of $G$:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item the kernel of the action,
          \begin{proof}
            The kernel of $G$ is the set $\{ g \in G \mid g \cdot a = a \text{ for all } a \in A \}$. It is closed under the binary operation of $G$: If $g_1, g_2$ are in the kernel, then $g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot a) = g_1 \cdot a = a$ for all $a \in A$. And, by definition of a group action, $g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot a) = (g_1 g_2) \cdot a$, which implies that $(g_1 g_2) \cdot a = a$, so $g_1 g_2$ is in the kernel of $G$.

            The kernel is also closed under inverses: Let $g$ be in the kernel of $G$. Then $1 \cdot a = (g^{-1} g) \cdot a = g^{-1} \cdot (g \cdot a) = g^{-1} \cdot a$. By definition, $1 \cdot a = a$, so $g^{-1} \cdot a = a$ for all $a$, so $g^{-1}$ is in the kernel. Thus the kernel of the action is a subgroup of $G$.
          \end{proof}
    \item $\{ g \in G \mid ga = a \}$ â€” this subgroup is called the \emph{stabilizer} of $G$.
          \begin{proof}
            The proof that this set of elements if a subgroup is identical to the one immediately above, but for a fixed $a$ as opposed to all $a \in A$.
          \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
