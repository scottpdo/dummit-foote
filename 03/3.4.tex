Prove that if $G$ is an abelian simple group then $G \cong Z_p$ for some prime $p$ (do not assume $G$ is a finite group).

\begin{proof}
    Since $G$ is simple, the only normal subgroups of $G$ are 1 and $G$ itself. However, since $G$ is abelian, any subgroup of $G$ must be normal, so it follows that $G$ contains \emph{no} subgroups other than 1 and itself.

    If $x_1, x_2 \in G$ are distinct generators for $G$, then $\langle x_1 \rangle$ and $\langle x_2 \rangle$ would be distinct subgroups of $G$; therefore $G$ is generated by a single element and is a cyclic group. Let us write $G = \langle x \rangle$. If $G$ were infinite, then for any $n > 1$, $\langle x^n \rangle$ would be a distinct subgroup of $G$, so $G$ must be finite.

    Finally, if $n$ divides $|G|$, then from Chapter 2, Theorem 7.(3), $G$ contains a proper subgroup of order $n$. Therefore $|G|$ has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so we have $|G| = p$ for some prime $p$. We conclude that $G \cong Z_p$ for some prime $p$.

Exhibit all 3 composition series for $Q_8$ and all 7 composition series for $D_8$. List the composition factors in each case.

The 3 composition series for $Q_8$ are:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0em]
    \item $1 \leq \langle -1 \rangle \leq \langle i \rangle \leq Q_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle -1 \rangle \leq \langle j \rangle \leq Q_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle -1 \rangle \leq \langle k \rangle \leq Q_8$
\end{enumerate}
In each series, each composition factor is isomorphic to $Z_2$ (thus each $N_i$ is normal in $N_{i + 1}$; since there is only one left coset it must equal the only right coset).

The 7 composition series for $D_8$ are:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0em]
    \item $1 \leq \langle s \rangle \leq \langle s, r^2 \rangle \leq D_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle sr^2 \rangle \leq \langle s, r^2 \rangle \leq D_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle r^2 \rangle \leq \langle s, r^2 \rangle \leq D_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle r^2 \rangle \leq \langle r \rangle \leq D_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle r^2 \rangle \leq \langle sr, r^2 \rangle \leq D_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle sr \rangle \leq \langle sr, r^2 \rangle \leq D_8$
    \item $1 \leq \langle sr^3 \rangle \leq \langle sr, r^2 \rangle \leq D_8$
\end{enumerate}
Again each composition factor is isomorphic to $Z_2$.
