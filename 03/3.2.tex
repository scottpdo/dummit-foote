Let $G$ be a group.

\section*{1. (10/1/23)}

Which of the following are permissible orders of subgroups of a group of order 120: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 15, 60, 240? For each permissible order give the corresponding index.

\begin{proof}
    From Lagrange's theorem, the order of a subgroup of a group of order 120 must divide 120. Then the permissible orders for subgroups are $1 = \frac{120}{120}$, $2 = \frac{120}{60}, 5 = \frac{120}{24}, 15 = \frac{120}{8}$, and $60 = \frac{120}{2}$. For each of these orders the index is given by the corresponding denumerator.
\end{proof}

\section*{2. (10/2/23)}

Prove that the lattice of subgroups of $S_3$ below is correct (i.e., prove that it contains all subgroups of $S_3$ and that their pairwise joins and intersections are correctly drawn).

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0, 0)          (1)  {$(1)$};
        \node at (-4, 1)      (12)  {$\langle (1, 2) \rangle$};
        \node at (-2.5, 1)      (13) {$\langle (1, 3) \rangle$};
        \node at (-1, 1)      (23) {$\langle (2, 3) \rangle$};
        \node at (1, 2)      (123) {$\langle (1, 2, 3) \rangle$};
        \node at (0, 3)       (S3)  {$S_3$};
        
        \draw (1) -- (12);
        \draw (1) -- (13);
        \draw (1) -- (23);
        \draw (1) -- (123);
        \draw (12) -- (S3);
        \draw (13) -- (S3);
        \draw (23) -- (S3);
        \draw (123) -- (S3);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{proof}
    The symmetric group $S_3$ contains 6 elements. By Lagrange's theorem, its proper subgroups must have order 2 or 3. Each of the subgroups in the lattice above have order 2 or 3, so there are no smaller or larger subgroups not depicted above.

    From Corollary 10, a subgroup of order 2 must be isomorphic to $Z_2$, that is, cyclic and generated by a single element of order 2. The three subgroups generated by the three elements of order 2 (the 2-cycles of $S_3$) are depicted above. Similarly, a subgroup of order 3 must be isomorphic to $Z_3$ and generated by a single element of order 3. The subgroup generated by $(1, 2, 3)$ contains $(1, 3, 2)$, so there is only a single subgroup of order 3.

    Next, again by Lagrange's Theorem, a subgroup of two different containing groups must have an order that divides the order of both of the containing groups. First consider a subgroup of order 2 and a subgroup of order 3. Only 1 divides 2 and 3, so the intersection must be the identity. Similarly, if a subgroup of order 2 and a subgroup of order 3 are contained in a larger group, then that group's order must have both 2 and 3 as divisors. The smallest integer for which this is possible is 6, which is the order of all of $S_3$.

    Finally, consider a pair of subgroups of order 2. Their intersection is either the identity or else they are the same subgroup. Their join must have even order, but 4 does not divide 6 and any larger even number exceeds the order of $S_3$. Thus their join is all of $S_3$. This concludes the proof that the lattice of subgroups of $S_3$ is correct.
\end{proof}

\section*{3. (10/2/23)}

Prove that the lattice of subgroups of $Q_8$ below is correct.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node at (0, 0)          (1)  {$1$};
        \node at (0, 1)      (-1)  {$\langle -1 \rangle$};
        \node at (-1, 2)      (i) {$\langle i \rangle$};
        \node at (0, 2)      (j) {$\langle j \rangle$};
        \node at (1, 2)      (k) {$\langle k \rangle$};
        \node at (0, 3)       (Q8)  {$Q_8$};
        
        \draw (1) -- (-1);
        \draw (-1) -- (i);
        \draw (-1) -- (j);
        \draw (-1) -- (k);
        \draw (i) -- (Q8);
        \draw (j) -- (Q8);
        \draw (k) -- (Q8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{proof}
    The group $Q_8$ has order $8 = 2^3$, so by Lagrange's theorem its proper subgroups must have order 2 or 4. We will start from the bottom and work toward the top: There is only one element of order 2 in $Q_8$, $-1$, and the cyclic subgroup generated by it is in the lattice.

    For each of $i, j$, and $k$, $\langle -1 \rangle$ is contained in the subgroup generated by them (ex. $\langle i \rangle = \{ \pm{1}, \pm{i} \}$) and there are no intermediate subgroups, since there is no divisor of 4 that is strictly greater than 2. At this point, every element of $Q_8$ is represented, so there are no cyclic subgroups missing. We might ask if there is a subgroup of order 4 missing. If so, it cannot be cyclic, and from Ch. 1.1, Exercise 36, it must be isomorphic to $V_4$. However, $V_4$ contains three elements of order 2, and $Q_8$ only has one, so there is no subgroup of $Q_8$ isomorphic to $V_4$.

    Finally, the join of any of the subgroups generated by $i, j$, or $k$ must contain strictly more than 4 elements and its order must divide 8. Then any of their joins must have order 8, that is, be all of $Q_8$.
\end{proof}

Show that if $|G| = pq$ for some primes $p$ and $q$ (not necessarily distinct) then either $G$ is abelian or $Z(G) = 1$.

\begin{proof}
    We will show, equivalently, that if $|Z(G)| > 1$, then $G$ is abelian.
    
    Let $x \in Z(G)$. From Corollary 9, the order of $x$ divides $|G| = pq$. If $|x| = pq$, then $G = \langle x \rangle$ and so is abelian. Suppose without loss of generality that $|x| = p$. Now since the center of a group is a subgroup, we must have $\langle x \rangle \leq Z(G)$. If there exists a $y \in Z(G), y \notin \langle x \rangle$, then the order of $Z(G)$ exceeds $p$ and must divide $pq$, then it must be all of $G$ and hence $G$ is abelian. So suppose $Z(G) = \langle x \rangle$.
    
    The center of a group is normal in that group, so $G/Z(G)$ is well-defined. Since $|Z(G)| = p$, it has $q$ cosets in $G$; that is, the quotient group $G/Z(G)$ has prime order $q$ and is thus isomorphic to $Z_q$, hence cyclic. From Ch. 3.1, Exercise 36., $G$ is thus abelian.
\end{proof}
