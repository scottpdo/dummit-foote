Let $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.
          \begin{proof}
            By induction. When $n = 1, \varphi(x^1) = \varphi(x) = \varphi(x)^1$.

            Suppose for some $n$, $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$. Then $\varphi(x^{n + 1}) = \varphi(x^n x)$. By definition, because $\varphi$ is a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)$ for all $a, b \in G$. So $\varphi(x^n x) = \varphi(x^n) \varphi(x)$. By the induction hypothesis, $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$, so this equals $\varphi(x)^{n + 1}$.

            Therefore $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.
          \end{proof}

    \item Do part (a) for $n = -1$ and deduce that $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
    
          This proof diverges slightly from the directions but arrives at the same result.
          
          Note that, for all $x \in G$, $\varphi(x) = \varphi(1 \cdot x) = \varphi(1) \varphi(x)$. Therefore $\varphi(1) = 1$ (in $H$). Now $1 = \varphi(1) = \varphi(x^n \cdot x^{-n}) = \varphi(x^n) \varphi(x^{-n})$. From part a), this equals $\varphi(x)^n \varphi(x^{-n})$. Left-multiplying both sides by $\varphi(x)^{-n}$, we obtain $\varphi(x^{-n}) = \varphi(x)^{-n}$, as desired.
          
\end{enumerate}

\section*{2. (3/26/23)}

If $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism, prove that $|\varphi(x)| = |x|$ for all $x \in G$. Deduce that any two isomorphic groups have the same number of elements of order $n$ for each $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.

\begin{proof}
    Let $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism and let $x \in G$. If $|x|$ is finite, then (from 1.a) $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n$ and (from 1.b) $\varphi(1) = \varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n = 1 \in H$. The order of the element $\varphi(x)^n \in H$ is therefore at most $n$. Because $\varphi$ is an isomorphism, there is only one element whose image is 1, and that is $\varphi(1) = 1$. Therefore for no $m < n$ do we have $\varphi(x)^m = 1$, and so the $|\varphi(x) = n$.

    Next, suppose that $x$ has infinite order in $G$. Then $x^n \neq 1$ for all $n > 0$. Because $\varphi$ is an isomorphism, we know that only $\varphi(1) = 1 \in H$. Therefore $\varphi(x^n) = \varphi(x)^n \neq 1$ for all $n > 0$. Therefore $|\varphi(x)| = \infty$.

    This result is not necessarily true if $\varphi$ is a homomorphism. For example, $\varphi$ could send every element of $G$ to the identity in $H$. (This is a homomorphism: $\varphi(x)\varphi(y) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$ and $\varphi(x)\varphi(y) = \varphi(xy) = 1$.) Then for all $x \in G$, $|\varphi(x)| = 1$, regardless of the order of $x$.
\end{proof}

\section*{3. (3/27/23)}

If $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism, prove that $G$ is abelian if and only if $H$ is abelian. If $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, what additional conditions on $\varphi$ (if any) are sufficient to ensure that if $G$ is abelian, then so is $H$?

\begin{proof}
    First, let $G$ be an abelian group and $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism. Given arbitrary distinct elements of $H$, because $\varphi$ is surjective, there are two distinct elements in $G$ whose images are these elements in $H$. Let $\varphi(x), \varphi(y) \in H$ be distinct elements and $x, y \in G$. Then $\varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y)$. Also, because $x$ and $y$ commute, $\varphi(xy) = \varphi(yx) = \varphi(y)\varphi(x)$. Therefore $\varphi(x)\varphi(y) = \varphi(y)\varphi(x)$, so $H$ is an abelian group.

    Next, let $H$ be an abelian group. Again let $\varphi(x), \varphi(y) \in H$ and $x, y \in G$. Then $\varphi(x)\varphi(y) = \varphi(xy)$. Also, $\varphi(x)\varphi(y) = \varphi(y)\varphi(x) = \varphi(yx)$. So $\varphi(xy) = \varphi(yx)$. Because $\varphi$ is one-to-one, this implies that $xy = yx$, and so $G$ is an abelian group.

    If $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, then $G$ being an abelian group does not imply that $H$ is abelian. For example, $H$ could be a non-abelian group and $\varphi$ could send every element of $G$ to the identity in $H$.

    A sufficient condition for a homomorphism $\varphi: G \rightarrow H$ to ensure that if $G$ is abelian, then so is $H$, is that $\varphi$ is surjective. Then for all $h \in H$, $h = \varphi(x)$ for some $x \in G$ (possibly more than one $x$). Let $h_1, h_2 \in H$ with $h_1 = \varphi(x_1) = \varphi(x_2) = ...$ and $h_2 = \varphi(y_1) = \varphi(y_2) = ...$ and with $x_i, y_j \in G$. $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, so for any $i, j$, $\varphi(x_i y_j) = \varphi(x_i) \varphi(y_j) = h_1 h_2$. Also, because $G$ is abelian, $\varphi(x_i y_j) = \varphi(y_j x_i) = \varphi(y_j) \varphi(x_i) = h_2 h_1$. Therefore $h_1 h_2 = h_2 h_1$, so $H$ is abelian.
\end{proof}

Prove that the multiplicative groups $\mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ and $\mathbb{C} - \{0\}$ are not isomorphic.

\begin{proof}
    For any $x \in \mathbb{R} - \{0\}$, $x \neq \pm{1}$, $x$ has infinite order. The proof of this is as follows: Let $x \in \mathbb{R} - \{0, \pm{1}\}$. If the absolute value of $x$ is greater than 1, then the absolute value of $x^n$ is greater than 1 for all $n$, and by induction $x$ has infinite order. If the absolute value of $x$ is less than 1, then the absolute value of $x^n$ is less than 1 for all $n$, and by induction $x$ has infinite order. So $1$ and $-1$ are the only elements of $\mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ with finite order.

    In $\mathbb{C} - \{0\}$, $i$ and $-i$ have order 4. From 2., isomorphic groups have the same number of elements of order $n$ for each $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. However, $\mathbb{R} - \{0\}$ has no elements of order 4, and $\mathbb{C} - \{0\}$ has at least 2. Therefore they are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\section*{5. (3/27/23)}

Prove that the additive groups $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic.

\begin{proof}
    Given that $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ do not have the same cardinality ($\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable while $\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite), there is no map $\varphi: \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that is surjective. An isomorphism is a bijection that is necessarily surjective, and so the two groups are not isomorphic.

    Alternatively, consider the homomorphism $\varphi: \mathbb{Q} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $\varphi(q) = q$. Such a map is injective but not surjective: There is no $q \in \mathbb{Q}$ with $\varphi(q) = \sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{R}$. If we attempt to make $\varphi$ surjective by assigning $\varphi(q_1) = \sqrt{2}$ for some $q_1$, then $q_1$ now has no preimage in $\mathbb{Q}$, and so we must find a $q_2$ and assign $\varphi(q_2) = q_1$. However, now $q_2$ has no preimage. This process continues \emph{ad infinitum}, and $\varphi$ is forever not surjective. Therefore $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\section*{6. (3/27/23)}

Prove that the additive groups $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic.

\begin{proof}
    Consider a homomorphism $\varphi: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$. For all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $\varphi(0) = \newline
    \varphi(n + (-n)) = \varphi(n) + \varphi(-n)$. From 1.b), $\varphi(0) = 0$, so $\varphi$ preserves inverses: $\varphi(-n) = -\varphi(n)$. That is, $\varphi(n) = q$ implies that $\varphi(-n) = -q$.

    We also claim that, if $\varphi(1) = k$, then $\varphi$ assigns all integers to their product with $k$ in $\mathbb{Q}$. Since $\varphi$ preserves inverses, we only have to show this for $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, by induction (base case given): Suppose that $\varphi(n) = kn$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Q}^+$. Then $\varphi(n + 1) = \varphi(n) + \varphi(1) = kn + k = k(n + 1)$, as desired. Therefore $\varphi$ assigns all integers to their product with $k$ in $\mathbb{Q}$.

    But now it is impossible for $\varphi$ to be surjective, because only integer multiples of $k$ have preimages in $\mathbb{Z}$. For example, $k / 2 \in \mathbb{Q}$ has no preimage. Therefore $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\section*{7. (3/27/23)}

Prove that $D_8$ and $Q_8$ are not isomorphic.

\begin{proof}
    $s, sr, sr^2, sr^3 \in D_8$ all have order 2. However, in $Q_8$, only $-1$ has order 2. From 2., isomorphic groups must have the same number of elements of each order. Therefore $D_8$ and $Q_8$ are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\section*{8. (3/28/23)}

Prove that if $n \neq m$, $S_n$ and $S_m$ are not isomorphic.

\begin{proof}
    Without loss of generality, let $n > m$. From Chapter 1.3, the order of a symmetric group $S_n$ is $n!$. Then $S_n$ contains $n!$ elements, and $S_m$ contains $m!$ elements. It is trivial to show that $n > m \Rightarrow n! > m!$. Since the two groups do not have the same cardinality, there is no bijection between them. Thus $S_n$ and $S_m$ are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\section*{9. (3/28/23)}

Prove that $D_{24}$ and $S_4$ are not isomorphic.

\begin{proof}
    $D_{24}$ has 24 elements, and $S_4$ has 24 elements. They are both non-abelian. In order to prove that they are not isomorphic, then, let us consider the orders of each group's respective elements.

    $D_{24}$ has 13 elements of order 2: $\{ sr^i \mid i \in \{0, ..., 11\} \}$ and $r^6$.

    The elements of order 2 in $S_4$ are those permutations with cycle decompositions that are disjoint 2-cycles: \newline
    $\{ (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (1,2)(3,4), (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3) \}$. So \newline
    there are 9 elements of order 2 in $S_4$.

    Since $D_{24}$ and $S_4$ do not have the same number of elements of order 2, they are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\section*{10. (3/31/23)}

Fill in the details of the proof that the symmetric groups $S_\Delta$ and $S_\Omega$ are isomorphic if $|\Delta| = |\Omega|$ as follows: Let $\theta: \Delta \rightarrow \Omega$ be a bijection. Define
\begin{equation*}
    \varphi: S_\Delta \rightarrow S_\Omega \text{ by } \varphi(\sigma) = \theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1} \text{ for all } \sigma \in S_\Delta
\end{equation*}
and prove the following:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item $\varphi$ is well-defined, that is, if $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\Delta$ then $\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1}$ is a permutation of $\Omega$.

        To show that $\varphi$ is well-defined, we need to show that it assigns a given permutation of $\Delta$ to a unique permutation of $\Omega$.

        An arbitrary permutation $\sigma$ is a bijection from $\Delta$ to itself. It is represented with a cycle decomposition that shows how it assigns a given element of $\Delta$ to another element. For $\sigma$ and a given element $s_1$, we can say that $\sigma$ assigns $s_1$ to $s_2 \in \Delta$.
        
        Since $\Delta$ and $\Omega$ have the same cardinality, there exists a bijection $\theta$ between them, and we can say that $\theta$ assigns distinct $s_1, s_2 \in \Delta$ to distinct $t_1, t_2 \in \Omega$, respectively.

        Now let us consider what happens when we apply $\varphi$ to $\sigma$. By definition, $\varphi(\sigma) = \theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1}$. $\theta^{-1}$ is a bijection: $\Omega \rightarrow \Delta$, $\sigma$ is a bijection: $\Delta \rightarrow \Delta$, and $\theta$ is a bijection: $\Delta \rightarrow \Omega$. Applying the compositions, we see that $\varphi(\sigma)$ is a map from $\Omega \rightarrow \Omega$ (not yet proven to be a bijection).
        
        $t_1$ is an arbitrary element of $\Omega$ with preimage $s_1 \in \Delta$. Then:
        \begin{equation*}
            \varphi(\sigma)(t_1) = \theta (\sigma (\theta^{-1}(t_1))) = \theta (\sigma(s_1)) = \theta(s_2) = t_2,
        \end{equation*}
        that is, $\varphi(\sigma)$ is a permutation of $\Omega$ that uniquely assigns $t_1$ to $t_2$. Therefore $\varphi$ is well-defined.
    
    \item $\varphi$ is a bijection from $S_\Delta$ onto $S_\Omega$.
        
        We have shown that $\varphi$ is a well-defined map from $S_\Delta$ onto $S_\Omega$. However, it remains to be shown that $\varphi$ is a bijection.

        To show that $\varphi$ is invertible, define a map $\gamma: S_\Omega \rightarrow S_\Delta$, with $\gamma(\tau) = \theta^{-1} \circ \tau \circ \theta$ for $\tau \in \Omega$. The proof above suffices to show that $\gamma$ is well-defined.

        Consider what happens when we take $\gamma(\varphi(\sigma))$:
        \begin{equation*}
            \gamma(\varphi(\sigma)) = \gamma(\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1}) = \theta^{-1} \circ (\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1}) \circ \theta = (\theta^{-1} \theta) \circ \sigma \circ (\theta^{-1} \theta) = \sigma.
        \end{equation*}

        That is, $\gamma(\varphi(\sigma)) = \sigma$ for all $\sigma \in S_\Delta$. Therefore $\gamma = \varphi^{-1}$. Since $\varphi$ has a well-defined inverse, it is a bijection from $S_\Delta$ onto $S_\Omega$.

    \item $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, that is, $\varphi(\sigma \circ \tau) = \varphi(\sigma) \circ \varphi(\tau)$.

        We apply the function compositions: 
        
        \begin{multline*}
            \varphi(\sigma \circ \tau) = \\
            (\theta \circ \sigma \circ \theta^{-1}) \circ (\theta \circ \tau \circ \theta^{-1}) =
            \theta \circ \sigma \circ (\theta^{-1} \circ \theta) \circ \tau \circ \theta^{-1} = \\
            \theta \circ \sigma \circ \tau \circ \theta^{-1} = \varphi(\sigma) \circ \varphi(\tau).
        \end{multline*}

        Thus $\varphi$ is a homomorphism, and since it is also a bijection, the groups $S_\Delta$ and $S_\Omega$ are isomorphic.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{11. (4/1/23)}

Let $A$ and $B$ be groups. Prove that $A \times B \cong B \times A$.

\begin{proof}
    Consider the map $\varphi: A \times B \rightarrow B \times A$ defined by $\varphi(a, b) = (b, a)$. $\varphi$ is injective, since $\varphi(a_1, b_1) = \varphi(a_2, b_2) \Rightarrow (b_1, a_1) = (b_2, a_2) \Rightarrow a_1 = a_2$ and $b_1 = b_2$. $\varphi$ is surjective, since for every $(b, a) \in B \times A$, there exists by definition $(a, b) \in A$ with $\varphi(a, b) = (b, a)$. Therefore $\varphi$ is a bijection from $A \times B \rightarrow B \times A$.

    $\varphi$ is also a homomorphism: Let $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2) \in A \times B$. Then:
    \begin{multline*}
        \varphi((a_1, b_1)(a_2, b_2)) = \varphi(a_1 a_2, b_1 b_2) = \\ 
        (b_1 b_2, a_1 a_2) = (b_1, a_1)(b_2, a_2) = \varphi(a_1, b_1) \varphi(a_2, b_2).
    \end{multline*}

    Since $\varphi$ is a bijective homomorphism, it is an isomorphism, and so $A \times B \cong B \times A$.
\end{proof}
