Let $R$ be a ring with 1.

\section*{1. (7/1/24)}

Show that $(-1)^2 = 1$ in $\mathbb{R}$.

\begin{proof}
    We have:
    \begin{align*}
        (-1) + (-1)^2 = \underbrace{(-1)(1)}_{\text{identity}} + (-1)(-1) = \underbrace{(-1)(1 + (-1))}_{\text{distribution}} = (-1)\underbrace{(0)}_{\text{inverses}} = 0,
    \end{align*}
    and therefore, since $(-1) + (-1)^2 = 0$, $(-1)^2 = 1$.
\end{proof}

\section*{2. (7/1/24)}

Prove that if $u$ is a unit in $R$ then so is $-u$.

\begin{proof}
    Recall that $u$ is a unit in $R$ if there exists some $v \in R$ such that $uv = vu = 1$.

    Now:
    \begin{align*}
        (-u)(v) = -(uv) &= -1, \text{ which implies that} \\
        (-u)(v)(-1) = (-1)^2 &= 1, \text{ so} \\
        (-u)(-v) = 1,
    \end{align*}
    which implies that $-u$ is also a unit in $R$.
\end{proof}

\section*{7. (7/5/24)}

The \emph{center} of a ring $R$ is $\{ z \in R \mid zr = rz \text{ for all } r \in R \}$ (i.e., is the set of all elements which commute with every element of $R$). Prove that the center of a ring is a subring that contains the identity. Prove that the center of a division ring is a field.

\begin{proof}
    Let $a, b \in R$ be in the center of $R$ and let $x \in R$. Then:
    \begin{equation*}
        (a - b)x = ax - bx = xa - xb = x(a - b),
    \end{equation*}
    so $a - b$ is in the center of $R$. And, since $a$ and $b$ both commute with $x$, we have $(ab)x = abx = xab = x(ab)$, so $ab$ lies in the center of $R$ as well. Since by definition 1 commutes with every element of $R$, the center of $R$ is a subring of $R$ containing the identity.

    If $R$ is a division ring, then every element in its center (except 0) has a multiplicative inverse (is a unit). Every element in its center also commutes with every other element. A field is a commutative ring where every nonzero element is a unit; therefore the center of a division ring is a field.
\end{proof}
